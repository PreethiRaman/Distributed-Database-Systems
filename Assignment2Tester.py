#Tester for students
# Do not hard code values in your program for ratings.
# table name and input file name.
# Do not close con objects in your program.
# Invalid ranges will not be tested.
# Order of output does not matter, only correctness will be checked.
# Use discussion board extensively to clear doubts.
# Sample output does not correspond to data in test_data.dat.
